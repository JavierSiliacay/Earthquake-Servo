ðŸ”„ Workflow: Step-by-Step Process of the Code
Initialization:

Serial communication begins at 9600 baud for monitoring delay values.

The servo motor is attached to digital pin 9.

The potentiometer is configured as an input on analog pin A0.

Main Loop Begins:

The potentiometer reads an analog value between 0 and 1023.

This value is mapped to a delay time between 169 ms (fast shaking) and 1000 ms (slow shaking).

Serial Output:

The mapped delay time is printed to the Serial Monitor for observation.

Servo Movement:

The servo moves to 180 degrees (full tilt).

A delay occurs based on the mapped time.

The servo moves to 0 degrees (opposite tilt).

Another delay follows.

This simulates a back-and-forth "shake" effect.

Loop Repeats:

The loop continuously updates servo behavior and delay time based on potentiometer position, creating a live-intensity simulation.
